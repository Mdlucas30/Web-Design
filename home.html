        <h2>About the Designer</h2>
        <h3>
        I have been enjoying web design so far. It has been somewhat difficult, But I have learned a lot of things on the way especially
        about the front-end of a webpage, putting designs, styles. Customizing the displays on the page. By far these are the area I have 
        been learning more about and enjoying a lot. Though there are some areas I still don't understand It's fun to learn something that 
        I will make use of in the near future. Sometimes I still get confused in some tags when making a webpage but I'm starting to understand it more clearly now.
        Web Design has a lot more areas into it that I don't know as of now, and what Iv'e been saying so far are only a few of what I've learned and will learn and this is why
        we need to keep studying harder.
